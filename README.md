# Data Visualization Project

The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis of how diamonds prices vary depending on several variables.

### Price by Size and Color

The first variables studied are how the price change due to size and color. It is observed that the D color are more expensive with smaller diamond size while H and I need a larger diamonf to reach the same price D color have a exponential price increase with size while I and H have logarithmic.
